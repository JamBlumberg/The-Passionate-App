# The-Passionate-App
iOS app created in Swift Playgrounds for iPad and Xcode using the rickies.net API

After downloading, to run and contibute to the app you will either need Xcode on the Mac or Swift Playgrounds on the iPad. In order to edit the project on the iPad the project folder must be contained in the Playgrounds folder in iCloud Drive so that the Playgrounds app can see it. 

You can use standard git branching strategies via git on the Mac or theoretically with an iPadOS git client like Working Copy (haven't tried this yet). All changes going into master must be made via pull request.
